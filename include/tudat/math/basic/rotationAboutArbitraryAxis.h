//! Compute rotation of point about arbitrary axis.
/*!
 * Computes the rotation of a point about an arbitrary axis. This function computes the position
 * of the rotated point by computing the displacement vector between the origin of rotation and
 * the initalPosition of point and then applying a matrix as shown in section 6 of
 * http://inside.mines.edu/~gmurray/ArbitraryAxisRotation/ArbitraryAxisRotation.html.
 * A visualization of the computation being performed can be found at
 * http://twist-and-shout.appspot.com/. Units for originOfRotation, and initialPositionOfPoint must
 * be the same. All positions are assumed to be with respect to a common arbitrary origin. Note
 * that this arbitrary origin is not necessarily the origin of rotation.
 * \param originOfRotation Position of tail of axis of rotation vector with respect to a chosen
 *        arbitrary origin.
 * \param angleOfRotation Angle about which the point rotates with respect to the axis of rotation
 *        [rad].
 * \param axisOfRotation Unit vector pointed in the direction of rotation determined by the
 *        right-hand rule.
 * \param initialPositionOfPoint Position of point before rotation with respect to the same chosen
 *        arbitrary origin.
 * \return Position of point after rotation about the axis of rotation with respect to the same
 *         chosen arbitrary origin.
