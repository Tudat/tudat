//! Izzo Lambert targeting algorithm class (zero revolution).
/*!
 * Solves the zero revolution Lambert problem using Izzo's algorithms, i.e. the two point boundary 
 * value problem of what kind of unperturbed Keplerian orbit connects two positions in a certain 
 * time of flight. 
 * 
 * This class uses lazy evaluation, solving the algorithm is postponed until the function call 
 * relying on the computations.
 * 
 * The algorithm used is based on the algorithm used in Izzo's PyKEP Keplerian toolbox, but is
 * implemented such that only one solution gets computed at a time. The approach from Izzo
 * transforms the problem into dimensionless parameters in terms of the initial position and
 * computes the solution in a 2D plane solving for Battin's x-variable. Contrasting the Izzo
 * approach, the non-dimensionalized parameters are stored internally in order to speed up future
 * recalculations.
 * 
 * \throws std::runtime_error For negative time of flight and gravitational parameter values.
 * \throws basic_mathematics::ConvergenceException When the internal rootfinding algorithm
 *              fails to converge within a reasonable amount of iterations.
