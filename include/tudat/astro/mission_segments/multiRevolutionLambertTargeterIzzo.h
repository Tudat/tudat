//! Izzo Lambert targeting algorithm class (multiple revolution).
/*!
 * Solves the multi revolution (input parameter) Lambert problem using Izzo's algorithms, i.e., the
 * two point boundary value problem of what kind of unperturbed Keplerian orbit connects two 
 * positions in a certain time of flight. 
 *
 * This class uses lazy evaluation, solving the algorithm is postponed until the function call 
 * relying on the computations.
 *
 * The algorithm used is the same algorithms as the zero revolution base
 * class (Izzo's method): only the computation of the time of flight (based on Battin's x-variable)
 * now includes the number of revolutions. The branch is required for specifying the neighborhood
 * of the two roots of the problem. Furthermore, the non-dimensionalized parameters are stored
 * internally and reused for new calculations of new solutions for the same object. 
 *
 * \throws std::runtime_error For negative time of flight and gravitational parameter values.
 *              Also, the number of revolutions is checked for feasibility: no negative values 
 *              are allowed and is checked against an automatic computation of the maximum number
 *              of revolutions.
 * \throws basic_mathematics::ConvergenceException When the internal rootfinding algorithm
 *              fails to converge within a reasonable amount of iterations.
