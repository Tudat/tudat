 * This class allows for a data stream to be filtered to remove comments starting with a
 * given character, e.g., "#".
 * When this character is the first of a line, the entire line is considered comment, and is removed.
 * When the comment appears in the middle of a line, only the text after this line is removed.
 * NOTE: The start of a comment is always a single character!
 * NOTE: You cannot escape the comment character!
 * NOTE: A comment always runs until the end of the same line!

 * Search for keyword:                      'myKeyWord'
 *      This will match all exact matches of 'myKeyWord'.
 *
 * Search for entire line with keyword:     '^.*myKeyWord.*$'
 *      This will match the line (from start to finish) if it contains the string "myKeyWord".
 *
 * Search for numbers with two decimals:    '[\+\-]*[0-9]*\.[0-9]{2}'
 *      This will match numbers up to two decimals (including preceding + and -).
