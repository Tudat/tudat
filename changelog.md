- **Aerodynamics** 
	- added tabulated atmosphere that supports a variable number (1 to 4) of independent variables (see issue [#376](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/376))
	- added function to compute aerodynamic (force and moment) coefficients from pressure and shear force distributions on body
	- added MCD atmosphere tables
	- added custom constant temperature atmosphere
- **Basics**
	- added function to return addition and multiplication identities for various types
- **Input Output**
 	- added class to write multi-dimensional arrays to file
- **Interpolators**
	- added option to choose interpolator behavior at boundary (see issue [#378](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/378)); supported modes: error, extrapolate (with optional warning), use boundary value (with optional warning), use default value (with optional warning)
	- added interface class `MultiDimensionalInterpolator` to make multi-dimensional interpolation more modular
- **Filters**
	- added base class for filters
	- added base class for Kalman filters
	- added linear, extended and unscented Kalman filters (see issue [#390](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/390))
- **Numerical Integrators**
	- modified constructor for RK integrators with variable step size to input all possible options
	- added another constructor to input vector of relative and absolute tolerances
- **Orbital Element Conversions**
	- added conversions for position and velocity state variables: Cartesian<->USM7, Cartesian<->USM6, Keplerian<->USM6, Cartesian<->USMEM, Keplerian<->USMEM
	- added conversions for attitude state variables: quaternion<->MRP, quaternion<->exponential map
- **Propagators**
	- added translational state derivative models: USM7, UMS6 and USMEM (see issue [#364](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/364))
	- added rotational state derivative models: MRPs and exponential map (see issue [#385](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/385))
- **Simulation Setup**
	- added function to output cumulative number of function evaluations (see issue [#375](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/375))
	- added function to output raw numerical solution
	- added function to post-process the propagated state during propagation (right after integration step) (also see issue [#364](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/364))
- **SPARTA**
	- added interface for running SPARTA simulations and analyzing its results (see issue [#380](https://github.com/Tudat/tudat/issues/380))
- **Utilities**
	- added function to extract both key and mapped values from map
- **Unit Tests**: all new functions and classes have been included in unit tests, with the exception of: SPARTA
- Various style, consistency and typo corrections; removed deprecated symbols and warnings
