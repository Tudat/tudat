 * This class serves as an example of how a container can be constructed that stored state and
 * time information, which can be used in conjunction with acceleration models, the Cartesian state
 * derivative model, and the composite state derivative model. It should be noted that this class
 * should NOT be used as is in the rest of the library, and is only used in conjunction with unit
 * tests. Classes of this nature should go in user applications, since they are typically
 * application-specific, hence not general enough to be added to the Tudat libraries.
 * \tparam SpatialDimensions Spatial dimensions of position and velocity vectors. The state vector
 *          is taken to be twice the number of spatial dimensions. All vectors are represented by
 *          Eigen::Matrix-types.
 * \tparam DataType The data type of all of the internally stored state-related vectors and time.
