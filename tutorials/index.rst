Tutorials and Documentation
===========================

If you've come all the way to this point, we assume that you have succesfully installed the Tudat Bundle. Congratulations! In this section of the wiki you will find all the required documentation to become a Tudat master in no time.

We recommend to start going through the :ref:`preknowledgeIndex` pages, since these contain essential information necessary to understand the rest of the tutorials. Once you feel confortable, we advise you to look at the :ref:`walkthroughsIndex`, which systematically explain some of the example applications included in the Tudat Bundle. These are very helpful to understand the interaction between the Tudat libraries and how a simulation is properly set up. Next, the :ref:`tudatFeaturesIndex` pages discuss the details behind a number of Tudat libraries common in most simulations.
