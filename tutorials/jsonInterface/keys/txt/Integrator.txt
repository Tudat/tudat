string | type | Method to use for the integration of the equations of motion. | o | rungeKutta4 | euler, rungeKutta4, rungeKuttaVariableStepSize

number | initialTime | Initial value of the independent variable (typically, seconds since J2000). If not provided, will be obtained from :jsonkey:`.initialEpoch`. | o

number | saveFrequency | Frequency with which the state is saved to the results map. For instance, a value of :literal:`5` means that the results are only saved for 1 in every 5 integration steps. | o | 1

boolean | assessPropagationTerminationConditionDuringIntegrationSubsteps | Whether the termination conditions defined in :jsonkey:`.termination` should be assessed after each integrator substep (e.g. for an RK4 integrator, after computing :literal:`k1`, :literal:`k2`, :literal:`k3`...). Not applicable to the Euler integrator. | o | false
