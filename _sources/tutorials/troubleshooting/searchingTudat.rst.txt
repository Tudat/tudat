Searching Tudat project files
=============================

Users can search the complete Tudat project from within Qt. This can be usefull e.g. for finding the input and output types of functions, for finding the derived classes of settings or searching for error messages given during runtime. This can help locate the source of a problem. 

Searching the complete project can be done by using ``ctrl+shift+f`` (or ``⇧⌘F`` on a Mac) which opens the following:

As an example the resulting output when searching for ``"Error in dynamics simulator, propagator settings not defined"`` is shown below:
