Download Tudat Bundle
=====================
The next step in the installation guide is to download the Tudat Bundle. This is a pre-configured setup that will allow us to get the libraries up and running in no time. The Tudat Bundle contains the following libraries:

- Tudat
- Boost (automatically downloaded and configured for your system when first building Tudat)
- Eigen
- cspice
- jsoncpp
- nrlmsise-00

To download the Tudat Bundle you have several options, which are more or less advanced and depend on your use case and experience with git. **Those students following the Space Project course at TU Delft should select the SmartGit (Developer) guide.**
